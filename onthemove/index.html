  <p>Connecting with local artists just starting to make a name for themselves we want to unite the creative minds to bring a new vision to the fore front. Everybody has the ability to create, and for the fact that there are so many long running talented artists, the fresh ones on the scene become undermined. No need to worry, we're painting a completely different picture here at OTM.</p>
