</body> The coast to coast trip will span for 9 days in the innovative city of Los Angeles. those who plan to attend this event will be imerrsed in music, culture, activities, views, and the overall experience LA has to offer. We at 24hrs are willing to fund the trips for 24 creative individuals who plan to work with our buisness. Not only will the 24 individuals be given full freedom to explore, and work in all types of studios pertaining to their skill and creative crafts of passion, but the final phase will be a grand opening of the new 24hrs Headquarters including a store front on the first floor, and different studios on each floor above in the building. We at 24hrs want to instill the late night early morning go getter life style amongst the people and this event/ trip will be the catalyst to set it all in motion
