  <p> In recent conversation with Graphic Artist Conner Mccormick he revealed the direction and purpose of his work. He says "I'd say my art is high in contrast and saturation. I like loud art in the sense that I like when my art pops out at you and isn't something you pass over". He continues yo expand on his statement drawing connections to his past work by stating "I started drawing cartoons when I was young, and wanted to gain more technique when I went to college in salt lake to try to blend the two styles."</p>
  
  <p> In terms of a website to assist his work I found that Conner was looking for something minimalistic in style for the fact that his work reads as "loud" or "high contrast". Conner took great interest in Joe Perez's Website who happens to be a designer associated with Donda Design; a firm that Conner draws inspiration from. <p>
